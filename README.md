# StressTypeVisualization
Mod for Polybridge 2 that makes it so you can distinguish between tensile and compressive stresses.

I'll be updating this since I haven't pushed some commits I have made, but for the moment this should be a stable version.

Has BepInEx and PolyTechFramework as dependencies.
In general all that is needed to mod PolyBridge2 is BepInEx by the way.
Future releases will not have PolyTechFramework as a dependency.
