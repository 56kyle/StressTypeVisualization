# StressTypeVisualization

## Overview
The primary purpose of this mod is to make the stress view show tensile vs compressive stress using different color coding.
However, the mod also has options for pausing the game after the first break and/or every break that occurs, as well as a threshold mode for only showing stress changes when they are above a chosen percent.

## Installation
Before starting make sure that PolyBridge 2 isn't open.
There are 2 different dependencies, BepInEx is the main one and should be installed before anything else.
The other is ConfigurationManager which is inside this release but can be updated if desired.
1. [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases)
2. [ConfigurationManager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager/releases)

Once both dependencies are met, extract and move the BepInEx folder in the release into your PolyBridge2 main directory and it should merge with the existing BepInEx folder. (If there is not an existing BepInEx folder, please make sure to download and install BepInEx)
Once this is done you should be able to open PolyBridge 2 and press F1 to open the mod menu. Inside should be all of the options for this mod aswell.
